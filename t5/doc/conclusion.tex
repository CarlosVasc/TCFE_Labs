\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this laboratory assignment the objective of analysing and optimizing a passband circuit using an AMP-OP was achieved. The discrepancies between the Ngspice simulation and the theoretical model computed through Octave are existent, yet considerably small, mostly explained by the greater complexity and exactitude of the Ngspice software. The optimization has also been achieved, since the circuit does function as a passband circuit, with a reasonable bandwith, centered around the frequency and gain established as goals.
