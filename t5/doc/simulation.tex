\section{Simulation Analysis}
\label{sec:simulation}

In this section, the intent is to simulate the circuit, using \textit{Ngspice} software with the model uA741 as the AMP-OP.

Time and, more importantly, frequency analysis were performed in order to evaluate the circuit in the passband (specifically, the output voltage gain along with its phase), the central frequency of the passband, and the input (Zin) and output (Zout) impedances in the central frequency. The following table represents the major results of interest.

\begin{table}[h]

      \input{../doc/op_Zout_tab.tex}
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Main results measured in NGSpice software.}
 \end{table}


The following figures are the computations of the output voltage gain and its phase as a function of frequency.
