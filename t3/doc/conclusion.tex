\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this laboratory assignment, the objective of analysing and designing an AC/DC converter circuit has been achieved. Measures and plots of the output and ripple voltages have been computed, theoretically using the Octave maths tool and by circuit simulation using the Ngspice tool, and the final output came close to a DC 12V voltage. The discrepancies between the results acquired from the different tool are the consequence of different models used in calculations, being the models used in Ngspice tool regarding diodes much more precise, exact and complex.
